Queries are represented in Jupyter Notebooks using Python against the WikiPathways SPARQL endpoint (http://sparql.wikipathways.org/).

## Python Jupyter Notebooks

These are the queries that are used to query the WikiPathways SPARQL endpoint.  Results of the queries are displayed in tabular format.  For each query, users can also locate the SPARQL query in the Python code and copy the query section making sure to only copy text between the quotation marks "".  The user can then paste the copied query into the SPARQL endpoint (http://sparql.wikipathways.org/) if they wish to edit the query to their liking and then select the "Run Query" button on the Virtuoso page to perform their own custom version of the copied query.
